Last Updated: April 20, 2017
PLEASE READ THIS TERMS OF USE AGREEMENT (THE “TERMS OF USE”) CAREFULLY. BY ACCESSING OR USING THE EXPERCHAT APP, SERVICE OR ANY OTHER SERVICES OF EXPERCHAT, INC., ITS AFFILIATES OR AGENTS ( “EXPERCHAT” ) WITH LINKS TO THIS AGREEMENT (COLLECTIVELY, THE “SERVICE” ) IN ANY WAY, INCLUDING USING THE SERVICES AND RESOURCES AVAILABLE OR ENABLED VIA THE APP OR SERVICE BY EXPERCHAT OR USERS OF THE SERVICE, COMPLETING THE REGISTRATION PROCESS, AND/OR MERELY BROWSING THE SERVICE, YOU REPRESENT THAT (1) YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF USE, (2) YOU ARE OF LEGAL AGE TO FORM A BINDING CONTRACT WITH EXPERCHAT, AND (3) YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO ENTER INTO THE TERMS OF USE PERSONALLY OR ON BEHALF OF THE COMPANY YOU REPRESENT, AND TO BIND THAT COMPANY TO THE TERMS OF USE. THE TERM “YOU” REFERS TO THE INDIVIDUAL OR LEGAL ENTITY, AS APPLICABLE, IDENTIFIED AS THE CUSTOMER WHEN YOU REGISTERED ON THE SERVICE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF USE, YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR USE THIS SERVICE OR THE SERVICES.
THE TERMS OF USE REQUIRE THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR CLASS ACTIONS, AND ALSO LIMIT THE REMEDIES AVAILABLE TO YOU IN THE EVENT OF A DISPUTE.
The “Services” consist of the following, without limitation: EXPERCHAT provides a SERVICE and mobile software application, (“Application”) for users (“Users”) to seek out and request video sessions with Independent Domain Experts ( “Experts” ) in a variety of subject matter fields and additional services that may be added by EXPERCHAT. The term “Users” refers to both Users and Experts.
PLEASE NOTE THAT THE TERMS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE BY EXPERCHAT IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION AT ANY TIME. When changes are made, EXPERCHAT will make a new copy of the Terms of Use available at the SERVICE, or through, the affected Service on the SERVICE. We will also update the “Last Updated” date at the top of the Terms of Use. If we make any material changes, and you have registered to use the Services, we will also send an e-mail to you at the last e-mail address you provided to us pursuant to the Terms. Any changes to the Terms will be effective immediately for new Users of the SERVICE or Services and will be effective thirty (30) days after posting of notice of such changes on the SERVICE for existing Users, provided that any material changes shall be effective for Users who have a registered account on the SERVICE upon the earlier of thirty (30) days after posting of notice of such changes on the SERVICE or thirty (30) days after dispatch of an e-mail notice of such changes to Registered Users (defined in Section 3.1 below). EXPERCHAT may require you to provide consent to the updated Terms in a specified manner before further use of the SERVICE or the Services is permitted. If you do not agree to any change(s) after receiving a notice of such change(s), you shall stop using the SERVICE and/or the Services. Otherwise, your continued use of the SERVICE and/or Services constitutes your acceptance of such change(s). PLEASE REGULARLY CHECK THE SERVICE TO VIEW THE THEN-CURRENT TERMS.
2. Use of the Services and EXPERCHAT Properties. The Application, the SERVICE, the Services, and the Content (collectively, the “EXPERCHAT Properties”) are protected by copyright laws throughout the world. Subject to the Terms, EXPERCHAT grants you a limited license to reproduce portions of the EXPERCHAT Properties for the sole purpose of using the Services for your personal or internal business purposes. Unless otherwise specified by EXPERCHAT in a separate license, your right to use any EXPERCHAT Properties is subject to the Terms.
2.1 Application License. Subject to your compliance with the Terms, EXPERCHAT grants you a limited non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to download, install and use a copy of the Application on a mobile device that you own or control and to run such copy of the Application solely for your own personal or internal business purposes. Furthermore, with respect to any Application accessed through or downloaded from the Apple App Store (an “App Store Sourced Application”), you will only use the App Store Sourced Application (i) on an Apple-branded product that runs the iOS (Apple’s proprietary operating system) and (ii) as permitted by the “Usage Rules” set forth in the Apple App Store Terms of Service. Furthermore, with respect to any Application accessed through or downloaded from the Google Play Store (an “Google Play Sourced Application”), you will only use the Google Play Store Sourced Application (i) on a product that runs Google Android (Google’s proprietary operating system) and (ii) as permitted by the “Usage Rules” set forth in the Google Play Store Terms of Service.

2.2 Certain Restrictions. The rights granted to you in the Terms are subject to the following restrictions: (a) you shall not license, sell, rent, lease, transfer, assign, reproduce, distribute, host or otherwise commercially exploit the EXPERCHAT Properties or any portion of the SERVICE, (b) you shall not frame or utilize framing techniques to enclose any trademark, logo, or other EXPERCHAT Properties (including images, text, page layout or form) of EXPERCHAT; (c) you shall not use any metatags or other “hidden text” using the EXPERCHAT name or trademarks; (d) you shall not modify, translate, adapt, merge, make derivative works of, disassemble, decompile, reverse compile or reverse engineer any part of the EXPERCHAT Properties except to the extent the foregoing restrictions are expressly prohibited by applicable law; (e) you shall not use any manual or automated software, devices or other processes (including but not limited to spiders, robots, scrapers, crawlers, avatars, data mining tools or the like) to “scrape” or download data from any web pages contained in the SERVICE (except that we grant the operators of public search engines revocable permission to use spiders to copy materials from the SERVICE for the sole purpose of and solely to the extent necessary for creating publicly available searchable indices of the materials, but not caches or archives of such materials) or to record all or any portion of any Expert Sessions; (f) access the EXPERCHAT Properties in order to build a similar or competitive SERVICE, application or service; (g) except as expressly stated herein, no part of the EXPERCHAT Properties may be copied, reproduced, distributed, republished, downloaded, displayed, posted or transmitted in any form or by any means; and (h) you shall not remove or destroy any copyright notices or other proprietary markings contained on or in the EXPERCHAT Properties. Any future release, update or other addition to the EXPERCHAT Properties shall be subject to the Terms. EXPERCHAT, its suppliers and service providers reserve all rights not granted in the Terms. Any unauthorized use of the EXPERCHAT Properties terminates the licenses granted by EXPERCHAT pursuant to the Terms.
2.3 Third-Party Materials. As a part of the EXPERCHAT Properties, you may have access to materials that are hosted by another party. You agree that it is impossible for EXPERCHAT to monitor such materials and that you access these materials at your own risk.
3. Registration.
3.1 Registering your Account. In order to access certain features of the EXPERCHAT Properties you may be required to become a Registered User. For purposes of the Terms, a “Registered User” is a User who has registered an account on the SERVICE (“Account”) using a valid email account.
3.2 Registration Data. In registering for the Services, you agree to (1) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself (the “Registration Data” ); and (2) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. You represent that you are (1) at least eighteen (18) years old; (2) of legal age to form a binding contract; and (3) not a person barred from using the EXPERCHAT Properties under the laws of the United States, your place of residence or any other applicable jurisdiction. You are responsible for all activities that occur under your Account. You agree that you shall monitor your Account to restrict use by minors, and you will accept full responsibility for any unauthorized use of the EXPERCHAT Properties by minors. You may not share your Account or password with anyone, and you agree to (1) notify EXPERCHAT immediately of any unauthorized use of your password or any other breach of security; and (2) exit from your Account at the end of each session. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or EXPERCHAT has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, EXPERCHAT has the right to suspend or terminate your Account and refuse any and all current or future use of the EXPERCHAT Properties (or any portion thereof). You agree not to create an Account using a false identity or information, or on behalf of someone other than yourself. You agree that you shall not have more than one Account at any given time. EXPERCHAT reserves the right to remove or reclaim any usernames at any time and for any reason, including but not limited to, claims by a third-party that a username violates the third-party’s rights. You agree not to create an Account or use the EXPERCHAT Properties if you have been previously removed by EXPERCHAT, or if you have been previously banned from any of the EXPERCHAT Properties.
4. Services. The following terms apply only to Users.
4.1 Scheduling. When selecting and confirming an Expert Session on the Services, you are agreeing to pay the applicable fee associated with that particular Expert (“Fee”). Confirming an order for an Expert Session constitutes a binding legal agreement to pay the Fee in accordance with the terms set forth in this Agreement. You acknowledge that when you confirm an Expert Session and agree to pay the applicable Fee, the Agreement you have formed is with the applicable Expert, and not EXPERCHAT, who is merely providing a service platform for Experts.
4.2 Cancelling Sessions. You may cancel a confirmed order up to twenty-four hours prior to the scheduled start time of the applicable Expert Session without incurring any Fee charges to your Account. In the event that you cancel within twenty-four hours of the scheduled start time, your Account will be charged 25% of the applicable Fee.
4.3 Recording Expert Sessions. You agree that you will not redistribute, retransmit or share any portion of any Expert Sessions or use it for any reason other than for personal use.
4.4 Payment. You agree to pay all fees or charges to your Account in accordance with the fees, charges, and billing terms in effect at the time a fee or charge is due and payable. You must provide EXPERCHAT’s third party payment processor with a valid credit card (Visa, MasterCard, American Express or any other issuer accepted by us) (“Payment Provider”) as a condition to signing up for the Services. Your Payment Provider agreement governs your use of the designated credit card, and you must refer to that agreement and not the Terms to determine your rights and liabilities. By providing EXPERCHAT’s third party payment processor with your credit card number and associated payment information, you agree that EXPERCHAT is authorized to immediately invoice your Account for all fees and charges due and payable to EXPERCHAT hereunder and that no additional notice or consent is required. You agree to immediately notify EXPERCHAT of any change in your billing address or the credit card used for payment hereunder. EXPERCHAT reserves the right at any time to change its prices and billing methods, either immediately upon posting on the EXPERCHAT Properties or by e-mail delivery to you.
4.5 Expert’s Taxes for Services. EXPERCHAT’s fees are net of any applicable Sales Tax. If any Services, or payments for any Services, under the Terms are subject to Sales Tax in any jurisdiction, you will be responsible for the payment of such Sales Tax and any related penalties or interest to the relevant tax authority and you will indemnify EXPERCHAT for any liability or expense we may incur in connection with such Sales Taxes. Upon our request, you will provide us with official receipts issued by the appropriate taxing authority, or other such evidence that you have paid all applicable taxes. For purposes of this section, “Sales Tax” shall mean any sales or use tax, and any other tax measured by sales proceeds, that EXPERCHAT is the functional equivalent of a sales tax where the applicable taxing jurisdiction does not otherwise impose a sales or use tax.
4.6 Withholding Taxes. You agree to make all payments of fees to EXPERCHAT free and clear of, and without reduction for, any withholding taxes. Any such taxes imposed on payments of fees to EXPERCHAT will be your sole responsibility, and you will provide EXPERCHAT with official receipts issued by the appropriate taxing authority, or such other evidence as we may reasonably request, to establish that such taxes have been paid.
4.7 Disputes. You must notify us in writing within seven (7) days after receiving your credit card statement, if you dispute any of our charges on that statement or such dispute will be deemed waived. Billing disputes should be communicated to Experchat’s Customer Service.
5. Expert Services. The following terms apply only to Expert Users.
5.1 Expert Accounts. Users of the Service who possess a valid Account may become Experts by following the directions on the SERVICE, at which time EXPERCHAT may require you to provide additional Registration Data. EXPERCHAT may use certain methods to screen potential Experts in an effort to prevent spam or to prevent repeat abusers of these Terms from creating an Expert Account. EXPERCHAT is providing the Service as a venue for connecting you with potential Users. You acknowledge that there is no employment, contractor, or joint-venture relationship between you and EXPERCHAT. BY CREATING AN EXPERT ACCOUNT, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY EXPERT SESSIONS YOU PROVIDE.
5.2 Offering Expert Sessions. Following the creation of your Expert Account, you will be able to use the Services to offer Expert Sessions in the fields for which you registered as an Expert at a Fee posted on the Service. Your Fee constitutes a valid offer to enter into a binding legal agreement with the User to provide the Expert Session for the specified price and in accordance with these Terms.
5.3 Expert Account Restrictions. You, as an Expert, represent and warrant that you will use the Services solely to provide Users with Expert Sessions in the fields for which you registered as an Expert. Specifically, you hereby represent, warrant, and covenant that you have the requisite knowledge and experience to provide instruction in such fields and that you will personally perform all Expert Sessions or Expert Courses you promote using the Services. You will use any information obtained from the Services solely in connection with the Services, and will not use such information in order to (a) arrange for Services with Users outside the context of the Service, (b) harass, abuse, or harm another person, or (c) to contact, advertise to, solicit, or sell any products or services to any User without that User’s prior explicit written consent. You will not attempt to impersonate another User or person, including, without limitation, any employee of EXPERCHAT or another Expert. At all times, you will use the Services in a manner consistent with this Agreement and any and all applicable laws and regulations. Without limiting the foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt, Experts are specifically prohibited from uploading, posting, emailing, transmitting or otherwise making available any information concerning any entity or individual that is confidential, proprietary or trade secret in nature.
5.4 Expert Payments. You, as an Expert, shall receive payments for each Expert Session you complete, and for which EXPERCHAT has received payment from the applicable User, based upon the price you charge for the Expert Session and EXPERCHAT’s then-current fee structure, less any chargebacks or refunds issued by EXPERCHAT in connection with any of your Expert Sessions. EXPERCHAT shall send you payment within approximately seven (7) days after the end of each calendar week using the payment method designated in your Registration Data, provided your total outstanding Expert Session earnings balance exceeds $30. In the event that these Terms are terminated without cause, EXPERCHAT will pay you any amounts owed to you under your outstanding Expert Session earnings balance within thirty (30) days after the end of the calendar month in which the Terms are terminated. Notwithstanding the foregoing, EXPERCHAT shall not be liable for any payment to you in the event that EXPERCHAT provides a User, at EXPERCHAT’s sole discretion, with a refund for a given Expert Session. EXPERCHAT reserves the right, at EXPERCHAT’s sole discretion, to withhold payment or charge back your account due to any breach of the Terms by you. To ensure proper payment, you are solely responsible for providing and maintaining accurate Registration Data. You agree to pay all applicable taxes or charges imposed by any government entity in connection with your use of the Services. You acknowledge that there is no employment, contractor or joint venture relationship between you and EXPERCHAT. You are solely responsible for, and will file, on a timely basis, all tax returns and payments required to be filed with, or made to, any federal, state or local tax authority with respect to receipt of fees in connection with serving as an Expert. Fees paid to Experts shall not be subject to withholding for any tax purpose. EXPERCHAT may change its fee structure at any time. Any payment disputes may be delivered to EXPERCHAT Customer Service.
6. Responsibility for Content.
6.1 Types of Content. You acknowledge that all Content, including Content included in any Expert Session or Expert Course, is the sole responsibility of the party from whom such Content originated. This means that you, and not EXPERCHAT, are entirely responsible for all Content that you upload, post, e-mail, transmit or otherwise make available ( “Make Available” ) through the EXPERCHAT Properties ( “Your Content” ), and other Users of the EXPERCHAT Properties, and not EXPERCHAT, are similarly responsible for all Content they Make Available through the EXPERCHAT Properties, including, but not limited to, any Expert Sessions and Expert Courses ( “User Content” ).
6.2 No Obligation to Pre-Screen Content. You acknowledge that EXPERCHAT has no obligation to pre-screen Content (including, but not limited to, Your Content and User Content), although EXPERCHAT reserves the right in its sole discretion to pre-screen, refuse or remove any Content (including any reviews or ratings provided by Users about Experts). By entering into the Terms, you hereby provide your irrevocable consent to such monitoring. You acknowledge and agree that you have no expectation of privacy concerning the transmission of Your Content, including without limitation chat, text, or voice communications. In the event that EXPERCHAT pre-screens, refuses or removes any Content, you acknowledge that EXPERCHAT will do so for EXPERCHAT’s benefit, not yours. Without limiting the foregoing, EXPERCHAT shall have the right to remove any Content that violates the Terms or is otherwise objectionable.
6.3 Storage. Unless expressly agreed to by EXPERCHAT in writing elsewhere, EXPERCHAT has no obligation to store any of Your Content that you Make Available on the EXPERCHAT Properties. EXPERCHAT has no responsibility or liability for the deletion of any Content, including Your Content; the failure to store, transmit or receive transmission of Content; or the security, privacy, storage, or transmission of other communications originating with or involving use of the EXPERCHAT Properties. Certain Services may enable you to specify the level at which such Services restrict access to Your Content. You are solely responsible for applying the appropriate level of access to Your Content. If you do not choose, the system may default to its most permissive setting. You agree that EXPERCHAT retains the right to create reasonable limits on EXPERCHAT’s use and storage of the Content, including Your Content, such as limits on file size, storage space, processing capacity, and similar limits described in the web pages accompanying the Services and as otherwise determined by EXPERCHAT in its sole discretion.
7. Ownership.
7.1 EXPERCHAT Properties. Except with respect to Your Content and User Content, you agree that EXPERCHAT and its suppliers own all rights, title and interest in the EXPERCHAT Properties (including but not limited to, titles, computer code, themes, objects, concepts, artwork, animations, videos, sounds, musical compositions, audiovisual effects, methods of operation, moral rights). You will not remove, alter or obscure any copyright, trademark, service mark or other proprietary rights notices incorporated in or accompanying the SERVICE, the Services, or the EXPERCHAT Properties.

Please remember that other Users may search for, see, use, modify and reproduce any of Your Content that you submit to any “public” area of the EXPERCHAT Properties. You warrant that the holder of any worldwide intellectual property right, including moral rights, in Your Content, has completely and effectively waived all such rights and validly and irrevocably granted to you the right to grant the license stated above. You agree that you, not EXPERCHAT, are responsible for all of Your Content that you Make Available on or in the EXPERCHAT Properties.

7.7 Your Account. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, you acknowledge and agree that you shall have no ownership or other property interest in your Account, and you further acknowledge and agree that all rights in and to your Account are and shall forever be owned by and inure to the benefit of EXPERCHAT.

8. Feedback. You agree that submission of any ideas, suggestions, documents, and/or proposals to EXPERCHAT through its suggestion, feedback or similar pages (“Feedback”) is at your own risk and that EXPERCHAT has no obligations (including without limitation obligations of confidentiality) with respect to such Feedback.

20. General Provisions.
20.1 Electronic Communications. The communications between you and EXPERCHAT use electronic means, whether you visit the EXPERCHAT Properties or send EXPERCHAT e-mails, or whether EXPERCHAT posts notices on the EXPERCHAT Properties or communicates with you via e-mail. For contractual purposes, you (1) consent to receive communications from EXPERCHAT in an electronic form; and (2) agree that all terms and conditions, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that EXPERCHAT provides to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications would satisfy if it were to be in writing. The foregoing does not affect your statutory rights.
20.2 Release. You hereby release EXPERCHAT Parties and their successors from claims, demands, any and all losses, damages, rights, and actions of any kind, including personal injuries, death, and property damage, that is either directly or indirectly related to or arises from any interactions with or conduct of other SERVICE Users or third-party SERVICEs of any kind arising in connection with or as a result of the Terms or your use of the EXPERCHAT Properties. If you are a California resident, you hereby waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which states, “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.
20.3 Assignment. The Terms, and your rights and obligations hereunder, may not be assigned, subcontracted, delegated, or otherwise transferred by you without EXPERCHAT’s prior written consent, and any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void. EXPERCHAT may freely assign the Terms.
20.4 Force Majeure. EXPERCHAT shall not be liable for any delay or failure to perform resulting from causes outside its reasonable control, including, but not limited to, acts of God, war, terrorism, riots, embargos, acts of civil or military authorities, fire, floods, accidents, strikes or shortages of transportation facilities, fuel, energy, labor or materials.
20.5 Compliance. If you believe that EXPERCHAT has not adhered to the Terms, please contact EXPERCHAT by emailing us at Customer_Service@EXPERCHAT.com. We will do our best to address your concerns. If you feel that your complaint has been addressed incompletely, we invite you to let us know for further investigation.
20.6 Limitations Period. YOU AND EXPERCHAT AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE TERMS, THE EXPERCHAT PROPERTIES OR THE CONTENT MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES. OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.
20.7 Dispute Resolution.
(a) Any claim or dispute (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as set forth below) in connection with the Terms where the total amount of the award sought is less than Five Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $5,000.00) may be resolved in a cost effective manner through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. Such arbitration shall be initiated through an established alternative dispute resolution provider (“ADR Provider”) that offers arbitration as set forth in this section and under the rules of such ADR Provider, except to the extent such rules are in conflict with the Terms. The party demanding arbitration will propose an ADR Provider and the other party shall not unreasonably withhold consent to use such ADR Provider. The ADR Provider and the parties must comply with the following rules: (1) the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions, the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration; (2) all arbitration proceedings shall be held in English; (3) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties; and (4) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Each party shall bear its own costs (including attorney fees) and disbursements arising out of the arbitration, and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider. Notwithstanding the foregoing, EXPERCHAT may seek injunctive or other equitable relief to protect its intellectual property rights in any court of competent jurisdiction. Please note that the laws of the jurisdiction where you are located may be different from Virginia law, including the laws governing what can legally be sold, bought, exported, offered or imported. You shall always comply with all the international and domestic laws, ordinances, regulations and statutes that are applicable to your use of the EXPERCHAT Properties.
(b) Any other dispute (including whether the claims asserted are arbitrable) shall be referred to and finally determined by binding and confidential arbitration. Arbitration shall be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act and not any state arbitration law. The arbitration shall be conducted before one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving commercial contract disputes from the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). As modified by the Terms, and unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties in writing, the arbitration will be governed by the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules and, if the arbitrator deems them applicable, the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively “Rules and Procedures”).
(c) You are thus GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend your rights EXCEPT for matters that may be taken to small claims court. Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR and NOT a judge or jury. You are entitled to a FAIR HEARING, BUT the arbitration procedures are SIMPLER AND MORE LIMITED THAN RULES APPLICABLE IN COURT. Arbitrator decisions are as enforceable as any court order and are subject to VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY A COURT.
(d) You and EXPERCHAT must abide by the following rules: (i) ANY CLAIMS BROUGHT BY YOU OR EXPERCHAT MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING; (ii) THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS, MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING, AND MAY NOT AWARD CLASS-WIDE RELIEF; (iii) in the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to costs of litigation, EXPERCHAT will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to the cost of litigation; (iv) EXPERCHAT also reserves the right in its sole and exclusive discretion to assume responsibility for all of the costs of the arbitration; (v) the arbitrator shall honor claims of privilege and privacy recognized at law; (vi) the arbitration shall be confidential, and neither you nor we may disclose the existence, content or results of any arbitration, except as may be required by law or for the purposes of enforcement of the arbitration award; (vii) the arbitrator may award any individual relief or individual remedies that are permitted by applicable law; and (viii) each side pays its own attorneys’ fees and expenses unless there is a statutory provision that requires the prevailing party to be paid its fees and litigation expenses, and then in such instance , the fees and costs awarded shall be determined by applicable law.
(e) The arbitral proceedings, and all pleadings and written evidence will be in the English language. Any written evidence originally in a language other than English will be submitted in English translation accompanied by the original or true copy thereof. The English language version will control. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator will not have authority to award damages in excess of the amount, or other than the types, allowed by Section 15 of the Terms. Judgment on the award of the arbitrator may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator also shall be authorized to grant any temporary, preliminary or permanent equitable remedy or relief it deems just and equitable and within the scope of the Terms, including, without limitation, an injunction or order for specific performance. The arbitration award shall be final and binding upon the parties without appeal or review except as permitted by California law or United States Federal law.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or EXPERCHAT may bring an individual action in small claims court. Further, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other party’s patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret shall not be subject to this arbitration agreement. Such claims shall be exclusively brought in the state or federal courts located in San Francisco County, California. Additionally, notwithstanding this agreement to arbitrate, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before the state or federal courts located in San Francisco County, California, in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration, and hereby agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the courts located within San Francisco County, California for such purpose. A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of the right to arbitrate.
(f) With the exception of (d)(i) and (ii) above (prohibiting arbitration on a class or collective basis), if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Rules and Procedures, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein. If, however, either (d)(i) or (ii) is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, and neither you nor EXPERCHAT shall be entitled to arbitration. If for any reason, a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, the dispute shall be exclusively brought in state court in in Fairfax County, Virginia or federal court in Alexandria VA. By using the EXPERCHAT Properties in any manner, you agree to the above arbitration provision.
For more information on AAA, its Rules and Procedures, and how to file an arbitration claim, you may call AAA at 800-778-7879 or visit the AAA SERVICE at http://www.adr.org.
20.8 Governing Law. The Terms and any action related thereto will be governed and interpreted by and under the laws of the State of Virginia, consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act, without giving effect to any principles that provide for the application of the law of another jurisdiction. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to the Terms.
20.9 Choice of Language. It is the express wish of the parties that the Terms and all related documents have been drawn up in English. C’est law volone expresse des parties que la presente convention ainsi que les documents qui s’y rattacent soient rediges en anglais.
20.10 Notice. Where EXPERCHAT requires that you provide an e-mail address, you are responsible for providing EXPERCHAT with your most current e-mail address. In the event that the last e-mail address you provided to EXPERCHAT is not valid, or for any reason is not capable of delivering to you any notices required/ permitted by the Terms, EXPERCHAT’s dispatch of the e-mail containing such notice will nonetheless constitute effective notice. You may give notice to EXPERCHAT at the following address: 12110 Sunset Hills Road STE 600, Reston, Virginia 20190. Such notice shall be deemed given when received by EXPERCHAT by letter delivered by nationally recognized overnight delivery service or first class postage prepaid mail at the above address.
20.11 Waiver. Any waiver or failure to enforce any provision of the Terms on one occasion will not be deemed a waiver of any other provision or of such provision on any other occasion.
20.12 Severability. If any provision of the Terms is, for any reason, held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of the Terms will remain enforceable, and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law.
20.13 Export Control. You may not use, export, import, or transfer the EXPERCHAT Properties except as authorized by U.S. law, the laws of the jurisdiction in which you obtained the EXPERCHAT Properties, and any other applicable laws.
